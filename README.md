# Evaluation Task for Software engineering interns.

## Project Description

You will be developing a web application for a charity organization to manage their donations. The application should allow donors to easily make donations and view their donation history. Additionally, the organization should be able to track and manage the donations they receive, and generate reports on donation trends. The application should have the following features:
